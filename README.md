# AI Engineer Roadmap

## Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Select this virtual environment when running your notebook with VS Code and install the ipython kernel when prompted.

Troubleshooting:

1. Attempt to relax versions, e.g. remove the `==x.x.x` part from the package in `requirements.txt` and retry.
2. Install libraries on an "as needed" basis. This allows you to get started right away and handle missing dependencies as you work through the course.
